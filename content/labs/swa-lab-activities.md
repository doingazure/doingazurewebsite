If you don't already have an Azure account, create one for free. (Having an account is free. Configuring services and resources can cost money. The SWA lab is expected to be free for today.)

You wil likely need to provide a credit card, even if your billing amount is expected to be $0. This is in part used by Microsoft as a fraud-prevention tool.

When using SWA in this lab, your costs are probably $0 per month, but maybe more (like $1). You can also delete all resources at the end of the day.
