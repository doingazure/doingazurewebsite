Lab for Boston Azure Bootcamp 13-May-2023. Here are the accounts you will need to complete the lab.

Accounts should be created up front.

## Azure Account

If you don't already have an Azure account, create one for free. (Having an account is free. Configuring services and resources can cost money. The SWA lab is expected to be free for today.)

You wil likely need to provide a credit card, even if your billing amount is expected to be $0. This is in part used by Microsoft as a fraud-prevention tool.

When using SWA in this lab, your costs are probably $0 per month, but maybe more (like $1). You can also delete all resources at the end of the day.

## GitHub

Create a free GitHub account.

Go to https://github.com/ and click on "Sign Up" in the top-right corner.
